        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup quick-melt cheese; shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil spaghetti in salted water on medium heat according to the pack's instructions or until firm to bite.
            Drain well, reserving some pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add the hotdogs into the saucepan and cook them whilst occasionally
            stirring every now and then for about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set aside once lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add onions, garlic and bell peppers to the pan and cook until soft.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook ground beef in the pan, occasionally stirring whilst also breaking beef into smaller pieces, until
            it is lightly browned. Drain excess fat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, banana ketchup, beef broth and some sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil and then lower heat to simmer whilst covered, for about 1 hour or until the meat is fully
            cooked and the sauce is thickened. If sauce is too thick for your liking, add a half cup of water
            incrementally until desired thickness is achieved.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the final 10 minutes of cooking, add the hotdogs, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with spaghetti sauce on the pasta topped with shredded cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
